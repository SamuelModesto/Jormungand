In Norse mythology, Jörmungandr, also known for having circled the earth as the serpent of the world, represents in this repository the serpent of the python.
This repository aims to fulfill a challenge of 100 projects in python, from the most basic to the advanced. The best projects will receive separate repositories for future contributions.
